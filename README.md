# Python Basics for Digital Ecosystem
This repository contains Python coding examples for the **Digital Ecosystem** course, focusing on basic Python programming concepts such as variables, data types, input/output, control flow, lists, loops, and functions. These examples are designed for students who are coding for the first time. The topics are organized chronologically and all will be covered in one lecture (session).

## Topics Covered
1. Variables & Data Types
2. Input and Output
3. Control Flow (if/else statements)
5. Lists (Arrays)
5. Loops (for/while)
6. Functions

## Getting Started
1. You can:
    - Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.
    - Downloading the entire repository as a ZIP file and extracting it
    - Browsing the files directly online through GitHub without downloading
2. Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. Open your favorite Python IDE or text editor. We will use [Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Notice that we can also write and run all the code examples online using [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/)
4. Open each file in sequence and run the code examples step-by-step.

## Code Files Sequence
1- **variables.py**: Example of variables and data types.
2- **input_output.py**: Example of user input and printing output.
3- **control_flow.py**: Example of if/else statements.
4- **interactive_program.py**: Example of interacting with user
5- **lists.py**: Example of lists and arrays.
6- **loops.py**: Example of loops (for/while).
7- **functions.py**: Example of defining and using functions.

## Future Topics
Next lecture will focus on working with **Python APIs**.
